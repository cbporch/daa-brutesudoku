# daa-brutesudoku
An adjustable size Sudoku puzzle solver using an iterative brute-force algorithm, which takes as input a text file containing the dimensions of the puzzle, then the sudoku puzzle itself with zeros in the unsolved "empty" squares, and iteratively finds a solution for it, then prints the solution along with the runtime.
